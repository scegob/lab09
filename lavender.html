            Lavandula (common name lavender) is a genus of 39 known species of flowering plants in the mint family, 
            Lamiaceae<a class="footnote" href="#footnote">[1]</a>. It is native to the Old World and is found from Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, 
            Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to southeast India. 
            Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for 
            garden and landscape use, for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of 
            essential oils. The most widely cultivated species, Lavandula angustifolia, is often referred to as 
            lavender, and there is a colour named for the shade of the flowers of this species

            Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            The genus includes annual or short-lived herbaceous perennial plants, and shrub-like perennials, 
            subshrubs or small shrubs.<a class="footnote" href="#footnote">[2]</a> Leaf shape is diverse across the genus. They are simple in some commonly 
            cultivated species; in others they are pinnately toothed, or pinnate, sometimes multiple pinnate and 
            dissected. In most species the leaves are covered in fine hairs or indumentum, which normally contain 
            the essential oils. Flowers are borne in whorls, held on spikes rising above the foliage, the spikes 
            being branched in some species. Some species produce coloured bracts at the apices. The flowers may be 
            blue, violet or lilac in the wild species, occasionally blackish purple or yellowish. The calyx is 
            tubular. The corolla is also tubular, usually with five lobes (the upper lip often cleft, and the lower 
            lip has two clefts).

            Shades of Lavender

            Lavender is a pale tint of purple. It applies particularly to the color of the flower of the same name. 
            The web color called lavender is displayed at the far left swatch. It matches the color of the very 
            palest part of the lavender flower. However, the more saturated color shown in the next cell to the 
            right is floral lavender. This more closely matches the average color of the lavender flower and is 
            the tone of lavender historically and traditionally considered lavender by the average person as 
            opposed to those who are web site designers.<a class="footnote" href="#footnote">[3]</a>
